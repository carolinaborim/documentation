# Getting started

If you are interested in getting access to our solutions, you just need
to follow these steps:

1. [Ask for credentials](#ask-for-credentials)
2. [Check your e-mail inbox](#check-your-e-mail-inbox)
3. [Reset your password](#reset-your-password)
4. [Authenticate](#authenticate)

## Ask for credentials

Access <a href="https://agco-fuse.github.io/" target="_blank">AGCO's
Developer Website</a> and request Sandbox access.
Our team will get in contact with you as soon as posible.

## Check your e-mail inbox

Once our team handle your request, you will receive two e-mails, one containing
the following information:

Property                 | Description
--------                 | -----------
`username`               | The provided email.
`password`               | A random alphanumeric password generated by the system (this need to be changed).
`URL to change password` | New users are required to change their passwords, otherwise authentication will fail.

A second e-mail containing your application's identifier for [authentication](#authenticate) purposes:

Property                 | Description
--------                 | -----------
`client_id`              | Application identifier to authenticate using [OAuth2](#authenticate-using-oauth2).
`client_secret`         | Application secret to authenticate using [OAuth2](#authenticate-using-oauth2).

## Reset your password

<aside class="notice">
New users are required to change their password. If you don't, you will
not be able to authenticate in any of our systems.
</aside>

Access [OneAGCO](https://aaat.agcocorp.com) and authenticate
using your e-mail address and the auto-generated password.

Once authenticated, you will be asked to change your password.

You also will be required to answer your security questions, as of the image below:

<aside class="notice">You must answer at least <code>3</code> questions.</aside>

## Authenticate

Our solutions support [OAuth2 authentication](#authenticate-using-oauth2) method.

## Authenticate using OAuth2

<blockquote class='lang-specific curl'><p>`curl` example of OAuth2 authentication:</p></blockquote>

```curl
curl -k -X "POST"\
    "https://aaat.agcocorp.com/auth/oauth2/access_token?realm=/dealers"\
    --data-urlencode "username=YOUR_USERNAME"\
    --data-urlencode "password=YOUR_PASSWORD"\
    --data-urlencode "scope=cn mail agcoUUID"\
    --data-urlencode "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"\
    --data-urlencode "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"\
    --data-urlencode "grant_type=password"
```

<blockquote class='lang-specific json'><p>HTTP 200 authentication response example:</p></blockquote>

```json
{
  "scope":"mail cn agcoUUID",
  "expires_in":7199,
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "refresh_token":"2483055a-cb08-4027-a8a9-03f89988d025",
  "access_token":"be9225f4-961a-49c5-bd0d-cf36cb855f69"
}
```

The data on the table below should be sent to the authentication service, in
order to generate a token:

| Field         | Data                                  |
| ---           | ---                                   |
| username      | The username received on email        |
| password      | The password set on the previous step |
| client_id     | The client id received over email     |
| client_secret | The client secret received over email |
| scope         | `cn mail agcoUUID`                    |
| grant_type    | `password`                            |

There is an example on the sidebar using `curl` with all the required data to
request an authentication token using your recently created credentials.

Use the token from the `authentication response` to authenticate the following
requests on different services. The token should be sent using a the
authorization header.

| Header        | Data                    |
| ---           | ---                     |
| Authorization | `Bearer {access token}` |

### Authentication response fields

Field           | Description
-----           | -----------
`scope`         | Requested scope
`expires_in`    | Token expiration time
`token_type`    | Access token type
`refresh_token` | Refresh token
`access_token`  | Access token

## How permissions are handled

<blockquote class='lang-specific curl'><p>Example of how to get models from Telemetry API using OAuth2 authentication:</p></blockquote>

```curl
curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"\
    "https://agco-fuse-trackers-sandbox.herokuapp.com/models"
```

The `token Bearer` corresponds to the user credentials and the APIs
will check which data can be retrieved.

To make sure everything is working fine you can try executing one
of the following examples available on the right side.

<aside class="notice">
All requests should contain an Authorization header.

# Getting started

This getting started is from who wants to get access to `AGCO's sandbox APIs` and learn about them.

The following steps will introduce the workflow about how to connect and retrieve data among `APIs`.

- [Ask for credentials](#asking-for-credentials)
- [Getting Access](#getting-access)
- [Authentication](#how-to-authenticate)
- [Making Requests](#making-requests)

## Asking for credentials

To get access to the `sandbox environment` is necessary to <a href="mailto:FuseInfo@agcocorp.com?Subject=Sandbox%20Access&Body=Hello,%0D%0A%0D%0AI would like to request access to AGCO's Sandbox Environment.%0D%0A%0D%0ARegards," target="_blank">send an email</a>
to `AGCO IT` asking for credentials. This request will be validated and send an email back with access credentials as soon as that is approved.

All the new sandbox users have they own test data such as `Dealer, Equipment and Telementry data`

# Introduction

Welcome to the AgCommand API documentation.

Here you will find more information about solutions currently offered by AGCO.

Our telemetry solutions are developed following a
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
architectural style. They support [JSON](http://www.json.org/) as the standard
data format.
This gives you flexibility on consuming information on any platform or
programming language.

Each solution is described in more details on the following sections.
Use the Table Of Contents on the left sidebar to navigate to a specific topic
for further information.

If you are interested in getting access to our solutions, there is a
[Getting Started](#getting-started) section for you.

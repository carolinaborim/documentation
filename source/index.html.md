# Introduction

Welcome to the AGCO Fuse API documentation. Here you will find more information
about the various endpoints available to access data from our platform, like
sample responses and status codes.

All the endpoints are developed with
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) in mind,
letting you programmatic access the information from a mobile application,
another webserver for processing information and displaying it later,
applications on any programming language and so on.

The responses of the endpoints are sent in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format
for ubiquitous access, being a webserver, mobile or web browser application.

Each of the enpoints are described with more details on the following sections.
Use the Table Of Contents on the left sidebar to navigate to a specific service
for further information.

To gain credential access to the APIs and learn how to authenticate, there is a
[Getting Started](#getting-started) section for you.
